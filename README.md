# Virus.Win32.Boofspeare
This is a virus that I created for educational pourposes. You can study this virus as much as you want, but keep in my mind you have to use it at your own risk.


Classification of this virus:
- **Eviorement**: *Files* (Hard Drive memory dumping and RAM failure)
- **Results after the exposure**: *Harmless ---> Hazardous* (in certain situations) 
- **Algorithm**: *Parasitic* (creates an endless number of 500MB empty files and opens an endless amount of photos; it basically puts the PC to a state where you can't use anymore, but a full power off-on the virus is killed, the only thing that remains are the files)
- **Type of Action**: *Stealth* (the process is hidden and the window is hidden, you can't close it)

**DISCLAIMER**

**DO NOT USE THIS VIRUS ON A REAL PC! IF YOU WANT TO USE IT AND HAVE "FUN" WITH IT, USE IT ON A VIRTUAL MACHINE!**
